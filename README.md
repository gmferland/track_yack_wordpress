A custom Wordpress theme for TrackYack. Right now it is very much tailored to their needs but I hope one day to tailor it into a theme that could be used for any blog. Based on the current shortcomings of the current theme, my biggest goal is a simple user experience. Using this idea as the central model to my theme, I'm focused on the following specific features: 

**Important content is front and center on the home page
**Small number of main navigation links
**Main navigation and featured content will load very quickly (utilizing inline css and no javascript when possible)
**Content is scalable to any size device
**Less important content and navigation is delegated to a footer or sidebar
**Well placed social media and brand logos
**Whenever possible try to guard against inconsistencies in content uploaded through wordpress admin interface, for instance photos of different resolution
